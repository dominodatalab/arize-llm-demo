## Development Dataset

Utilizes document parsing, OCR, and NLP for metric extraction. Based on information extraction theory and deep learning approaches
All documents are genuine, pre-approved financial reports; no personal data present.
Risks: Extraction errors, data quality issues, unauthorized access
Metrics: Extraction accuracy, input format validation, access logs
Review: Monthly dashboard; integrated with internal monitoring tools
Improved OCR preprocessing for scanned documents
